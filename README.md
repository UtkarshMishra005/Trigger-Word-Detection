# Trigger-Word-Detection
* Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.  
* Developed a deep learning model for Trigger Word Detection
* For this project, our trigger word will be "Activate." Every time it hears word "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound.  

In this project we will work on:
1. Structure a speech recognition project
2. Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets
3. Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions
